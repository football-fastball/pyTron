pyTron
=======================

The portable version of PyThor that can be also downloaded at www.pythor.us 

The way it works is to run the initial PHP file, you may rename this initial file any name you'd like (underscores are recommended to be used spaces)
the subsequent files will be created with the same name as this PHP file.

Then the program will automatically create the following four files:

pytron_nice_page_name.py

pytron_nice_page_name_compiled.py

simple_preprocessor.py

simple_preprocessor_auto_print_literal.py


Now edit your pyThor program, this is the pytron_nice_page_name.py file.

Please note, only the pytron_nice_page_name.php is necessary to run pyTron, the four files previously listed are just to show what will be generated by running the PHP program.

Usage:  Your web server will serve the PHP file, page requests are to be made to the PHP file.  But it will serve your pyTron program (written in Python with quick tags, see PyThor for details at this time).

After making changes to your source code, pytron_nice_page_name_compiled.py must be deleted, then running the .php file will re-create the file.
Later versions of pyTron will automatically determine whether the source has been modified and will compile it automatically for you.

Enjoy.
